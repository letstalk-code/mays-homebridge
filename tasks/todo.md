# May's Homebridge - Premium 5-Page Website Build

## Plan

### What We're Building
A 5-page, conversion-optimized, luxury website for May's HomeBridge — a real estate advocacy service for first-time homebuyers. Uses dark psychology copywriting (provided), premium aesthetics, and integrated booking/payments. Must be 5x better than drugscreenexpress.com.

### Design Direction
- **Colors from logo**: Metallic Gold (#C5A55A / gradient), Silver (#C0C0C0), Deep Charcoal (#1a1a1a)
- **Backgrounds**: White (#FFFFFF) / Off-white (#FAFAFA)
- **CTA Buttons**: Metallic Gold with charcoal text
- **Fonts**: Montserrat (headlines, bold modern) + Inter (body, clean readable)
- **Vibe**: Luxury, spacious, trustworthy, premium real estate
- **Mobile-first** with sticky CTA on mobile

### 5-Page Structure
1. **Homepage** (`/`) — Full sales framework with hero, pain points, solution, benefits, social proof, offer, scarcity, guarantee, CTA
2. **About / Why Me** (`/about`) — Authority building, personal story, differentiation, credentials
3. **Process / How It Works** (`/process`) — 5-step HomeBridge System explained
4. **Testimonials / Results** (`/testimonials`) — Real client reviews with analysis
5. **Contact / CTA** (`/contact`) — Final conversion push, booking embed, contact form

### Shared Components
- **Navigation**: Sticky, white bg + shadow, logo left, links center/right, gold "Book Consultation" CTA
- **Footer**: Deep charcoal bg, white/silver text, contact info, social links
- **Mobile sticky CTA**: Gold button follows scroll
- **Scroll animations**: Subtle fade-in on scroll (professional, not flashy)

- Zoom consultation link (auto-generated via GHL)
- Stripe payment ($100 session) via GHL
- Contact form (Name, Email, Phone, Message)
- Google Analytics 4 tracking placeholders

### SEO
